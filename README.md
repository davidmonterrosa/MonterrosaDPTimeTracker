## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

If you would like to practice working with JSON data, we provide a local `data.json` file for the activities. This means you'll be able to pull the data from there instead of using the content in the `.html` file.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

## PEER REVIEW

Peer Reviewed By:Alexander Soria
>Your recration is really well done! You got the design down to a tee, and its fully responsive to how it's shown in the prototype. Your data is populated nicely, and changes through each of the three options easily. I do like the detail of the highlighted option remaining highlighted when that's the hours being shown (weekly staying highlighted when the weekly hours are being shown, for example). I genuinely cannot find anything wrong with this page. You did an amazing job!
